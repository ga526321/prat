Prat is a light framework for chat modules based on Ace2 libraries.

The Prat system consists of the core (Prat/Prat.lua) and a number of integrated Prat modules in the modules folder (Prat/modules/**).  The core only provides a root slash command ('/prat') and registers a data file (PratDB).  Each Prat module is a self-contained unit of functionality.  You can choose to use some or all of the Prat modules depending on your individual needs.  If you do not want to use a particular module, you can delete its file from the modules folder or you can toggle the module on/off as desired from inside the game.**

The entire focus of the Prat system is to add chat related functionality to World of Warcraft.  If you are looking for a feature or function that is not currently listed here as available or planned, then please take a moment to let the Prat Development Team know.

**Why the name Prat?**

Why the name Prat?  That's a great question that I've seen asked quite often on the IRC channel.  In theory the word Prat loosely translates to Chat in swedish.  The system itself has nothing to do with Sweden, however inspiration for the name was drawn from thoughts of The Swedish Chef (Bork! Bork! Bork!), IKEA, Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate (Mmm..), Swedish Meatballs (Mmm..), and Swedish Swimsuit Models (Mmm..).  It may help users to accept the name if they, too, think of these things.  ^^
